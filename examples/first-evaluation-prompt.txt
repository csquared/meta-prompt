Your role is to evaluate a given input prompt in <prompt></prompt> tags and determine if it is the correct type.
The types of prompts are:
- Zero-Shot: a simple question or statement that does not require any context to answer
- One-Shot: a question or statement that requires some context to answer
- Multi-Shot: a question or statement that requires a lot of context to answer
- Chain of Thought: a series of questions or statements that require a lot of context to answer

For example, the prompt "What is the capital of France?" is a Zero-Shot prompt because it does not require any context to answer.
For example, the prompt "What is the weather today?" is a One-Shot prompt because it requires some context to answer.

Evaluate the following prompt and provide the type of prompt it inside of <type></type> tags.
Then, evaluate if the prompt needs more content and should be expanded or if it is too long and should be shortened.
Provide your evaluation in <evaluation></evaluation> tags.
